# countdown-solver
This program easily and efficiently solves the tasks given on the popular TV-show Countdown (and 8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown).

# Letters Game
The program takes in the stack of given letters as a single string without a seperator (e.g. "vonrmeods") and outputs all valid words of 5 letters and above, or until it finds a solution. The letters game is solved using a comprehensive list of over 466k english words. Please note that despite the list only containing valid english words, not all words follow the rules for accepted solutions on Countdown.
